# EULA Bot

I created a simple EULA bot that requires users to send a private message containing a phrase to a bot in order to be manually added to a MC Anarchy server Whitelist.

## Installation

Copy [main.js](https://github.com/Mannotcool/eula-bot/releases/tag/1.0.0) from the ZIP and run it, also add your bots token at the bottom.
